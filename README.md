Every hour a turbofan stays mounted past its safe-life threshold is a safety risk; every hour it gets pulled early is wasted capacity. Predictive maintenance lives in that gap. This project predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan fleet — a benchmark for exactly that trade-off.

RandomForest with engineered features achieves **RMSE ~46 cycles** on the test set, outperforming linear baselines by 4x.

Built with scikit-learn and pandas.

## Results

Trained on 80/20 engine split. Best model selected by validation RMSE.

**Test RUL RMSE: 45.97 cycles** (RandomForest)

| Model | RUL RMSE | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| RandomForest | 45.97 | Best performer |
| GradientBoosting | 49.05 | Strong alternative |
| Lasso | 185.23 | Linear baseline |
| LinearRegression | 185.88 | Simple baseline |

## Dataset

[NASA C-MAPSS FD001](https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/CMAPSS-Jet-Engine-Simulated-Data/ff5v-kuh6) — 100 turbofan engines run to failure with multivariate sensor time-series:

- **100 training engines** (complete run-to-failure)
- **100 test engines** (truncated before failure)
- **26 columns:** unit_number, time_in_cycles, 3 operational settings, 21 sensors
- **Single fault mode:** HPC degradation

---

## Approach

**Strategy:** Predict total lifespan (cycles until failure), then derive RUL:

```
RUL = predicted_lifespan - current_cycle
```

This avoids data leakage from direct RUL regression on sequential data.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Aggregated features: mean, std, min, max per sensor
- Trend features: slope, range, delta from mean
- 137 total features per engine

**Models Compared:**
- Linear: LinearRegression, Lasso (with StandardScaler)
- Ensemble: RandomForest, GradientBoosting

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set dataset path via environment variable or edit `config.py`:

```bash
export RUL_DATA_DIR="/path/to/CMAPSSData"
```

The directory should contain `train_FD001.txt`, `test_FD001.txt`, and `RUL_FD001.txt`.

---

## Usage

Train and compare all models:

```bash
python main.py
```

Run evaluation only:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

All hyperparameters are in `config.py`.

## Key Implementation Details

- **No data leakage:** Train/val split is per-engine, not per-row
- **Zero-variance removal:** Constant columns dropped before training
- **Online prediction:** RUL estimated at each cycle using partial history
- **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seed (42) for all splits and models
